# Introduction

The lab aimed to familiarize us with reliability assessment techniques such as C-SFRAT and the Reliability Demonstration Chart, as well as using Excel to analyze failure data. We will also have the opportunity to learn about reliability growth testing, which helps identify changes in a product's reliability over time. By examining failure data, we will determine how to prevent future failures. Through this lab, integration test data will be analyzed using both reliability growth testing and the Reliability Demonstration Chart, which allowed us to create models and plots for calculating MTTF, failure intensity, and software reliability. Also, each section of this lab serves the purpose of enhancing our understanding of reliability analysis and measurement, and we hope to learn how reliability certification can determine software quality. Ultimately, the lab will help us in recognizing when testing is necessary during software development.
