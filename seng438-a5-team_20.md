# Introduction

The lab aimed to familiarize us with reliability assessment techniques such as C-SFRAT and the Reliability Demonstration Chart, as well as using Excel to analyze failure data. We will also have the opportunity to learn about reliability growth testing, which helps identify changes in a product's reliability over time. By examining failure data, we will determine how to prevent future failures. Through this lab, integration test data will be analyzed using both reliability growth testing and the Reliability Demonstration Chart, which allowed us to create models and plots for calculating MTTF, failure intensity, and software reliability. Also, each section of this lab serves the purpose of enhancing our understanding of reliability analysis and measurement, and we hope to learn how reliability certification can determine software quality. Ultimately, the lab will help us in recognizing when testing is necessary during software development.

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

Reliability Growth Analysis and Reliability Demonstration Chart are two system reliability techniques that can provide crucial insights about the Software Under Test (SUT) and its testing. Their similaririties include:

* Reliability Growth Analysis and Reliability Demonstration Chart are system reliability techniques.
* Both techniques rely on inter-failure times and MTTF.
* The same dataset of failures was used as input for both techniques.
* Both techniques were applied to test the same system.

Both Reliability Growth Analysis and Reliability Demonstration Chart interpret the data differently to develop distinct reliability plots for the system. Their differences include:

* Reliability Growth Analysis and Reliability Demonstration Chart interpret data differently to generate reliability plots for the system.
* Reliability Growth Analysis uses failure count and inter-failure times, while RDC only uses inter-failure times.
* Reliability Growth Analysis employs exponential and logarithmic Poisson models to estimate λ/λF ratios and track failure intensity trends.
* RDC uses Discrimination Ratio, Consumer Risk, and Developer Risk to evaluate the acceptability of the SUT.
